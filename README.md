##  Project: Cats vs Dogs Image Classification and Web Deployment using Django
# Overview:
Developed a full-stack web application using Django to classify images of cats and dogs, leveraging a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development, allowing users to upload an image and get a prediction about whether it is a cat or a dog.

# Key Contributions:
Developed a CNN Model: Trained a CNN using Keras and TensorFlow on the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset (25,000 images), achieving a 81% accuracy.

Integrated ML with Django: Built a Django web application to serve the trained model. Users can upload images and receive real-time predictions on whether the image is of a cat or a dog.

Data Preprocessing: Utilized ImageDataGenerator to perform data augmentation, improving model generalization (e.g., rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip).

User Interface: Designed a responsive web interface using Django for easy user interaction.

# Technical Stack:
Machine Learning:

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV for image preprocessing.

Model Architecture: CNN with multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and fully connected layers.

Accuracy: Achieved 81% accuracy on the validation set.

Web Development:

Backend: Django framework for creating and managing views, URL routing, and handling requests.

Frontend: HTML, CSS for building a clean, user-friendly interface.

# Key Features:
User Uploads: Users can upload images via a simple web interface, and the application provides predictions on whether the image is of a cat or a dog.
Real-time Inference: The model processes user-submitted images and returns predictions in real-time.

# Challenges and Solutions:
Challenge: Handling large image datasets during training and ensuring the model doesnâ€™t overfit.

Solution: Applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming, and used dropout in the fully connected layers to regularize the model.

Challenge: Integrating a machine learning model with a web framework for real-time predictions.

Solution: Created a Django project to handle requests and feed images into the trained model for predictions.

# Results:
Performance: Achieved 81% accuracy.
